My goal is to build autonomous systems that are intuitive about their surroundings, and that can use their intuition to function independently and help others. I am fascinated by how human beings can systematically see, understand, and act on their understanding. I aspire to combine various architectures to build AI systems that extend this human visual intuition and understand the world in real-time.
