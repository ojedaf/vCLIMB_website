I have always stood out for my responsibility, perseverance, excellent academic results, and good technical and research skills. In this way, I have achieved several academic recognitions, among which Erasmus Mundus scholarship and ANID scholarship awarded by the Chilean government to do a PhD in computer science. In the PhD study, I have developed skills in deep learning frameworks like Pytorch, Pytorch-Lightning, and Comet-ml. Currently, I am an IALab member, focused on outperforming the current models in the task of action classification in video with few examples to train the model.
